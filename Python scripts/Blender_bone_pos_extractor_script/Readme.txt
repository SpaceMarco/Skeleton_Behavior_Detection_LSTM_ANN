Place the Blender_bone_extracor.py inside a folder that holdes the animations in folders.
because we use the folders names as classes.

ex: the script is placed in the Animations folder
the walking animations are placed in Animations/Walking
the Jumping animations are placed in Animations/Jumping
..etc.
