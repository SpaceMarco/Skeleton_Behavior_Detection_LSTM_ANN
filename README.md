# Skeleton_Behavior_Detection_LSTM_ANN
3D action behavior is a system presented to detect 3D poses/actions using different methods and techniques.

A basic classification model of LSTM ANN architecture was constructed using Keras APIs to verify that the model can distinguish between the six types of animations.

The 6 different classes were represented by the following numbers which start from 0 and ends with 5:
